    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you learned how to control the flow of your programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Logic\n",
    "- **Boolean values**: `True` and `False`\n",
    "- **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`\n",
    "- **Logical operators**: `and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Making\n",
    "- **`if` statements**: Execute code when condition is True\n",
    "- **`if-else`**: Choose between two options\n",
    "- **`if-elif-else`**: Choose among multiple options\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "- **`for` loops**: Repeat for each item in a sequence\n",
    "- **`while` loops**: Repeat while a condition is True\n",
    "- **`break`**: Exit a loop early\n",
    "- **`continue`**: Skip to next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "1. **Indentation matters** in Python - use 4 spaces\n",
    "2. **Conditions** are expressions that evaluate to True or False\n",
    "3. **Choose the right loop**: `for` when you know iterations, `while` when based on condition\n",
    "4. **Nesting**: Control flow can be inside other control flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If statement\n",
    "if temperature > 100:\n",
    "    print(\"Too hot!\")\n",

    "# For loop\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "\n",
    "# While loop\n",
