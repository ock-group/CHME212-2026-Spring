    "Python is one of the most widely used programming languages and runs on all major operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows. As free, open-source software maintained by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). Python offers two key major advantages. First, it is universally accessible—anyone can download and use it at no cost, regardless of budget. Second, because it is open source, its underlying code is publicly available for inspection and modification. This transparency allows users and developers to verify how the software works, rather than relying solely on claims made by its distributors."
