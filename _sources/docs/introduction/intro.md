# Welcome to CHME 212 Course

Scientific computing leverages computers to support tasks such as **data processing, simulations, and modeling**. In **chemical engineering**, it plays a central role in:

- **Process modeling and simulation:** Predicting reactor performance, separation processes, and heat and mass transfer  
- **Process optimization:** Maximizing yield, efficiency, or energy savings  
- **Control and monitoring:** Analyzing sensor data for real-time process control  
- **Material and property prediction:** Estimating thermodynamic, transport, or kinetic properties  
- **Safety analysis:** Simulating worst-case scenarios to design safer processes  

Learning programming allows students to implement these models, analyze results, and extend their work to emerging areas such as **machine learning, data-driven process optimization, and predictive modeling**. No prior programming experience beyond first-year chemical engineering knowledge—including heat and mass balances, basic mathematics, and chemistry—is assumed. Python is particularly effective because it is:

- **Easy to learn and use**, even for beginners  
- **Versatile**, supporting numerical computing, data analysis, visualization, and modeling  
- **Extensible through libraries**, such as NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn  
- **Free and open-source**, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- **Widely adopted in industry and research**, making skills directly transferable, especially for **machine learning applications**

Learning Python equips students to perform traditional modeling tasks **and extend their work to machine learning, predictive modeling, process optimization, and advanced data analysis**, preparing them to tackle modern challenges in chemical engineering.
