    "### Problem 2: P-V Diagrams for Van der Waals Gas\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to use the above van der Waals equation of state Python function to graph p-V diagrams for the temperatures defined in the file \"temperatures.dat\". You will need to create one plot with P-V diagrams for all temperatures, as well as one output datafile containing p-V data for each temperature. Proceed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a)** In addition to the math library (`import math`), import the numerical Python library called NumPy using the shortcut name np:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, import Matplotlib visualization library using the shortcut name plt:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Read the temperature data from the \"temperatures.dat\" file into a list as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "T = np.loadtxt('temperatures.dat', comments='#', dtype='float')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, the \"comments\" keyword indicates to omit lines starting with \"#\" sign (i.e., treat them as comments), and assign the datatype of temperature values to be floats. Check that you have correctly read the values: print the whole list; print any element from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** To provide 1000 equidistant volume points in the range from 0.05 to 0.3, use the following command:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "volume = np.linspace(0.05, 0.3, 1000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will need to loop over this space of volumes using for-loop and save the results into one plot. In this plot each line will correspond to a different temperature. Thus, you will have 6 pressure lists (P1, P2, etc.) for each temperature. Start with empty lists such as `P1 = []` and then populate them using `P1.append` method. Create the p-V plot for all six temperatures from the file \"temperatures.dat\". Add x and y labels. Add the title \"The van der Waals equation of state for CO2\". Save the plot into a file using the following command:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "savefig('vdW_PV_diagram.png')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use two different settings for figure quality: dpi=300 and dpi=50. Save two files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Save the p-V data into six files each one for a given temperature. E.g, the file \"vdW_PV_50K.dat\" would correspond to 50 K. The file should begin with the following two lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# T = 50 K\n",
    "# P, V\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use the format keyword to create such filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** It is recommended to implement two for-loops here, one for the temperature range and one for volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** It is better to create a list of lists for pressures (i.e., creating a two-dimensional matrix). This way you can access elements with two indices as P[i][j]."
