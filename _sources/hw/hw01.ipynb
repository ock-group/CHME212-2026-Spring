    "\n",
    "Write a Python script that converts temperature between scales given a user-specified numerical value and units (K, C, F).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Version (10 pts):\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should:\n",
    "1. The user specifies a temperature value (e.g., 100.0) and its units (e.g., C for Celsius)\n",
    "2. Convert the input temperature to the two other temperature scales (e.g., `C` -> `K` and `F`)\n",
    "3. Print the results with clear descriptive text and units\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Input: `100.0` and `C`\n",
    "- Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  100.0 C is equal to:\n",
    "  373.15 K\n",
    "  212.0 F\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus Version (+5 pts):\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a more robust version that can understand the temperature scale by the **first letter only** (case insensitive).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should correctly interpret all of these as Kelvin:\n",
    "- `K`, `k`, `Kelvin`, `KELVIN`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test your bonus version with these examples:**\n",
    "- `300` with units `K` → should convert to C and F\n",
    "- `300` with units `Kelvin` → should convert to C and F\n",
    "- `300` with units `k` → should convert to C and F"
