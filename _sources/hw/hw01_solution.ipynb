    "\n",
    "Write a Python script that converts temperature between scales given a user-specified numerical value and units (K, C, F).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Version (10 pts):\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should:\n",
    "1. The user specifies a temperature value (e.g., 100.0) and its units (e.g., C for Celsius)\n",
    "2. Convert the input temperature to the two other temperature scales (e.g., `C` -> `K` and `F`)\n",
    "3. Print the results with clear descriptive text and units\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Input: `100.0` and `C`\n",
    "- Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  100.0 C is equal to:\n",
    "  373.15 K\n",
    "  212.0 F\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a more robust version that can understand the temperature scale by the **first letter only** (case insensitive).\n",

    "The ideal gas law becomes more accurate under conditions where intermolecular interactions are negligible and the finite volume of molecules is small compared to the total volume of the gas. This typically occurs at high temperatures and low to moderate pressures. At elevated temperatures, gas molecules have higher kinetic energy, which reduces the relative importance of attractive intermolecular forces, making the gas behavior closer to ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal gas assumption may break down at high pressures and low temperatures. At high pressures, the volume occupied by gas molecules is no longer negligible, and repulsive interactions become important. At low temperatures, attractive forces between molecules can no longer be ignored, potentially leading to deviations from ideality or even phase transitions such as condensation. Gases with strong intermolecular forces (e.g., polar gases) tend to deviate from ideal behavior more significantly under these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 600 K, the temperature is relatively high for most common gases. If the calculated pressure is not excessively high (for example, well below the critical pressure of the gas), the ideal gas assumption is generally reasonable and defensible. At this temperature, thermal energy dominates intermolecular interactions, and deviations from ideal behavior are expected to be small. Therefore, for many engineering calculations, assuming ideal gas behavior at 600 K and moderate pressure is appropriate."
